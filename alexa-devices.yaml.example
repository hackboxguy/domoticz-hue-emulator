# Domoticz Hue Emulator Configuration
# ====================================
# Copy this file to alexa-devices.yaml and customize for your setup.
#
# This file configures devices and scenes that Alexa can control
# via the Philips Hue emulation bridge.

# Domoticz Server Configuration
domoticz:
  url: "http://YOUR_DOMOTICZ_IP:8080"
  username: "YOUR_USERNAME"
  password: "YOUR_PASSWORD"

# Hue Bridge Emulator Settings
bridge:
  port: 80                    # Port for Hue API (Alexa expects 80)
  ip: null                    # Auto-detect, or set like "192.168.1.100"

# Devices Configuration
# ---------------------
# Each device maps to a Domoticz device by its IDX
#
# Types:
#   - switch: On/Off only
#   - dimmer: On/Off + Brightness
#   - rgb: On/Off + Brightness + Color (for RGBWW lights)
#
# Voice commands:
#   "Alexa, turn on <name>"
#   "Alexa, set <name> to 50 percent"
#   "Alexa, set <name> to red" (rgb only)
#   "Alexa, set <name> to warm white" (rgb only)

devices:
  # Example RGB/RGBWW light
  - name: "Light"
    idx: 10
    type: rgb

  # Example switch
  - name: "Kitchen Light"
    idx: 20
    type: switch

  # Example dimmer
  - name: "Bedroom Light"
    idx: 30
    type: dimmer

# Scenes Configuration
# --------------------
# Scenes/Groups trigger Domoticz scenes or groups
# Use Groups (not Scenes) if you need both On and Off support
#
# Find scene/group IDX in Domoticz: Setup > More Options > Scenes/Groups
#
# Voice commands:
#   "Alexa, turn on <name>"    -> Activates the scene/group
#   "Alexa, turn off <name>"   -> Deactivates (groups only)

scenes:
  # Example group (supports on/off)
  - name: "All Lights"
    idx: 1
    description: "Controls all lights"

# Alexa Routines Tip
# ------------------
# For custom phrases like "Alexa, let's start the party":
# 1. Create a scene above named "Party Mode"
# 2. Open the Alexa app on your phone
# 3. Go to: More > Routines > + (create)
# 4. When this happens: Voice > "let's start the party"
# 5. Add action: Smart Home > Control device > "Party Mode" > Turn On
# 6. Save
#
# Now "Alexa, let's start the party" will trigger your Domoticz scene!
